## What We Need

| Role | How You Can Help |
|------|------------------|
| **Creators** | Test the framework against your own AI use. Does it fit? What's missing? |
| **Designers** | Visual badge concepts, icons, color schemes |
| **Writers** | Clarity improvements, plain-language summaries |
| **Translators** | Make this accessible globally |
| **Domain Experts** | How does this apply in law, medicine, journalism, music, etc.? |
| **Developers** | Badge generators, validators, website |
| **Critics** | Poke holes. What won't work? What's naive? |

## Guidelines

- Be constructive
- Assume good intent
- Focus on the framework, not individuals
- Remember this is about transparency, not judgment of AI use
