# Creative Transparency Initiative

**v0.1 DRAFT** — Seeking feedback before public release

---

I wanted to share a project I've been working on. It's inspired by Creative Commons and it's an attempt to give people a transparent, nonjudgmental way to disclose how and when AI gets used creatively.

## The Problem

Right now, "I used AI" doesn't tell you anything. Spell-check? Logic Drummer laying down a beat? A straight Suno prompt? They all get lumped together, and the specter of AI makes people doubt whether creative work is actually yours.

## How It Works

The Creative Transparency Initiative breaks the creative workflow into four components:

**A**: Authorship — Whose idea was it?  
**E**: Execution — Who did the work?  
**R**: Refinement — Who polished it?  
**V**: Verification — Who checked it?

Each dimension can be tagged **h** (human), **a** (assisted), or **m** (machine).

### Examples

I might code a message as `Ah-Va` (my idea, I had help with the sanity check at the end). It could just as well be `Ah-Eh-Ra-Vh` (I thought it, wrote it, had help with the edit, verified it myself).

A track might be `Ah-Em-Rh-Vh` (your composition, AI generated the stems, you mixed it, you verified the output).

Use as much or as little as you need. The disclosure is entirely up to you. It's assumed that anyone choosing to "CT code" their work is operating in good faith.

## Why This Matters

One of the difficult things we all face is the ambiguity surrounding what is and isn't generative creativity. Music production is full of comparisons between using loops, drum machines, and virtual performers. Most producers wouldn't think to label their productions using Logic Drummer as generative assistance. We've developed norms around what counts as human creativity even when machines are involved.

But AI blurs those lines in new ways. No one labels their writing as AI-assisted because they used spell-check. But what about grammar check? Predictive text? Because a lot of our assumptions about this are going to change, we have to acknowledge that some of this has to do with social norms and conventions.

In the interest of being transparent but not judgmental, anyone using this system is making a good-faith attempt to be transparent. A traditionalist who prides themselves on doing everything by hand might interpret "human origin" one way, and someone who uses an LLM to generate random images to inspire a songwriting session might claim the same. The common factor is the desire to disclose.

The point here is this isn't about policing. It's a way to acknowledge that we all want to be recognized for good creative work. I think it's the common human desire to take credit for our own ideas while acknowledging the force multiplier of the tools we use.

This system is not about keeping track of whether the agent on the phone is a real person or determining if one AI model is biased. Those are valid concerns but separate issues. This initiative is about the very human desire to give ourselves credit for our own ingenuity while acknowledging the use of tools.

## Get Involved

This is a work in progress and I think it's something our community and others like it need. If you'd like to be part of developing it, let me know.

### About This README

**Code:** `Ah-Eh-Rh-Vh`

This was my idea (inspired by Creative Commons). I wrote the specifications and this README. I worked through some problems and permutations using Claude AI. The current state of the specifications and repository are verified by me.
