# Naming Discussion

> **Status:** Open question — seeking input

## Why This Matters

One of the first decisions we need to make is settling on a name.

Creative Commons isn't just a good idea—it's a good idea with a name people can understand and get behind. If we want people to embrace this standard and adopt it, there's a branding component we need to nail.

The term "AI" is loaded and also not particularly accurate. Machine learning, large language models, generative AI—the terminology is already shifting. We need something that's:

- **Understandable** — People get it immediately
- **Future-proof** — Won't feel dated in 5 years
- **Non-judgmental** — No embedded bias about AI use
- **Inclusive** — Works across industries and contexts

There's no point in creating a spec if the first point of failure is the name.

## The Problem

**"AI Transparency Commons"** has issues:

| Concern | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| "AI" is loaded | Hype, fear, misunderstanding—the term carries baggage |
| "AI" may be dated | The field moves fast; today's term may feel outdated in 5 years |
| "AI" is vague | Covers everything from spell check to AGI |
| "Transparency" is long | Three syllables, slightly clinical |
| No clear acronym | "ATC" means air traffic control |

## What We're Actually Naming

Two things need names:

### 1. The Project/Framework

What do we call this initiative? Options:

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| AI Transparency Commons | Clear, links to CC | "AI" baggage, long |
| Creator Transparency Commons | Human-focused | Doesn't mention the technology |
| Origin Commons | Short, about provenance | Vague |
| Provenance Commons | Accurate | Academic, cold |
| Assisted Commons | Neutral | Doesn't say what kind of assistance |
| Open Disclosure Commons | Broad | Generic |
| [Something new] | Fresh, ownable | Requires explanation |

### 2. The Technology Term

What do we call the "AI/machine/automated" thing in our codes and descriptions?

| Term | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| AI | Everyone knows it | Loaded, vague, may date poorly |
| Machine | Neutral, broad | Cold, robotic connotation |
| Automated | Accurate | Clunky, four syllables |
| Computational | Precise | Academic |
| Synthetic | Technical | Negative connotation (synthetic = fake) |
| Assisted | Relationship-focused | Doesn't name the assistant |
| Algorithmic | Accurate | Technical, four syllables |

## Criteria for a Good Name

A name should be:

1. **Clear** — People understand it without explanation
2. **Neutral** — No embedded judgment about AI use
3. **Future-proof** — Won't feel dated as technology evolves
4. **Short** — Easy to say, write, remember
5. **Distinct** — Doesn't collide with existing terms
6. **Ownable** — Domain available, not trademarked

---

## Creative Commons as Model

"Creative Commons" works because:

- **Creative** — Describes the domain (creative works)
- **Commons** — Implies shared, public, community-owned

Following that pattern:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Domain] Commons | Creator Commons, Origin Commons |
| [Action] Commons | Disclosure Commons, Transparency Commons |
| [Relationship] Commons | Collaboration Commons, Assisted Commons |

## The "AI" Question

Do we even use the word "AI" anywhere?

**Option A:** Keep "AI" in the name, accept the baggage
- Pro: Everyone knows what we're talking about
- Con: Carries hype/fear, may date

**Option B:** Avoid "AI," use neutral term
- Pro: Future-proof, less loaded
- Con: Requires more explanation

**Option C:** Use "AI" in marketing, neutral term in spec
- Pro: Best of both—findable but precise
- Con: Inconsistent

## Ideas to Explore

Some directions worth considering:

- **Human-first framing:** "Creator Disclosure Commons" (focus on the human)
- **Relationship framing:** "Collaboration Commons" or "Co-Creation Commons"
- **Provenance framing:** "Origin Commons" or "Source Commons"
- **Action framing:** "Disclosure Commons"
- **Invented term:** Create something new (risk: requires adoption)

## What's Your Take?

We're looking for input on:

1. What should the project be called?
2. What term should we use for "AI/machine" in the codes?
3. Does the name need "AI" in it for discoverability?
4. Is there a term we haven't considered?
